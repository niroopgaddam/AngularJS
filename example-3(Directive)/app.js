/**
This example calculates employee's maximum eligible amount under EAP.
In the corresponding 'emp-eap-form.html' file we have declared Emp Name and CTC as required field 
but there is no html element with '*' symbol in this file.
We are creating this element in 'requiredDirective.js' via a custom directive.
Further, we are using Angular Form Validation to know more about this refer: https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/forms
